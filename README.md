# Initial Solidity introduction

I made a basic solidity contract, deployed in Rinkeby, where the contract is a public message that you can read and update it

First i used a local test network using ganache
And used web 3.0 library to deploy contracts
I also used mocha to test the contracts before deploying them in the Rinkedby network

To edit the contract, i used remix for now
